# ResGEM
Official code for the TVCG paper "ResGEM: Multi-scale Graph Embedding Network for Residual Mesh Denoising"

### Environment
Pytorch and Pytorch Geometric are required.

### Usage
We temporally provide PREPROCESSED Synthetic data and checkpoint of the first normal regression iteration, which can be run by the following command:
```
python infer.py --testset ./data/test --data_type Synthetic --graph_type DENSE_FACE --resume ./ckpt/Synthetic_nn.pth --save_dir ./data/results
```
